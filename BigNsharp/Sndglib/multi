Need to be able to load an array of soundings

this means load_sounding should probably be rewritten to take a list of times

another way to do it would be to change the curdataptr stuff to take a
list of times. that probably makes the most sense since at any one time you
would want to load multiple times from a single file versus multiple times
from multiple files

What about the situation of overlaying multiple soundings from multiple files?

Do we want to keep the limitation of 1 overlay at a time? if so, that makes
life a lot easier.

Do we want to implement a history mechanism to quickly recall previous
soundings? that would be cool. You'd have to store 
filename, time, and station, and data type. essentially a copy of curdataptr.
neato. give it some thought.
Yes. I've decided that we want this. this is more for NSHARP than for the
library though. at least the GUI part. the logic needs implementation here.
Think about having the ability to cache the sounding data so we don't have
to reread the datafile instead. think of the memory implications of doing it
this way.


loadalltimes()
{
  foreach time
    set curdatatype_ptr->time to $time
    load_sounding()
    copy sounding into array of loaded soundings (pointer actually)
  endforeach

  reassign curdatatype_ptr->time to $time[0]
}

i guess you could do the same thing but do loadallstations() for a single time
yes. do this.
you'll load all stations within mapbounds. This requires some thought though.
Don't wanna load all PFCs though! yikes!

keep track of:
current index
number of soundings loaded

if (numberloaded == 1) then
  load into index 1 so that we can overlay with the sounding in index 0
elseif (numberloaded == 0) then
  load into index 0
else
  load onto the end
endif

What to do about having a sounding loaded but then on your next go around
loading numerous times?

at what point do you zero out numberofsoundingsloaded?

I guess some data stuff like this makes sense:

#define MAXSNDG 128
short nsndgloaded=0;     /* # of soundings loaded */
short cursndgidx=0;      /* The index of the the currently loaded sounding */
Sounding *allsoundings[MAXSNDG];
make sure you initialize each pointer to NULL!
